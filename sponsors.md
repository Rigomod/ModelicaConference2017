MapleSim is a Modelica-based system-level modeling and simulation tool that applies modern techniques to dramatically reduce model development time, provide greater insight into system behavior, and produce fast, high-fidelity simulations. The combination of Modelica with the symbolic computation power of MapleSim enables a level of understanding, power, and extensibility not possible with “black-box” tools.
