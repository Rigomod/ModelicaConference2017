<b>Abstract:</b>The paper describes a model of a typical photovoltaic (PV) system. Unlike models previously described in literature, heat transfer phenomena are accounted for simultaneously with the electrical dynamics. Furthermore, the model is simulated for a time scale of one full year.<br />

<b>Abstract:</b>There is a strong focus on new renewable energy sources,
such as, solar power, wind energy and biomass, in the con-
text of reducing carbon emissions. Because of its maturity,
hydropower is often overlooked. However, there is an era
of hydro oriented research in improving many aspects of
this well established technology.
Representing a physical system of a hydropower plant
by mathematical models can serve as a powerful tool for
analysing and predicting the system performance during
disturbances. Furthermore it can create opportunities in
investigating more advanced control method.
A simulation model of a reference hydropower station
located in northwest of Iceland was implemented using
the modelling language Modelica. The main simulation
scenarios of interest were: 20 % load rejection, worst-case
scenario of full shut-down and pressure rise in the pressure
shaft due to the water hammer effect. This paper will show
that the different simulation scenarios were successfully
carried out based on the given the data available of the
Fossárvirkjun power plant. The load rejection simulation
gave expected results and was verified against a reference
results from manufacturer.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> Periodic Steady State Identification of electrical circuits </i> <br />
<b>Authors:</b> <a href="../authors/author_146.html">Martin Kuhn</a><br />
<b>Abstract:</b>This paper focuses on methods for stationary periodic steady state identification of systems. An overview is given and a method suitable for AC connected electrical on-board network is proposed.<br />
