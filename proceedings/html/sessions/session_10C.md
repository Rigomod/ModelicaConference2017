<b>Abstract:</b>In this paper, an efficient approach for the modelling and simulation of slender beams subject to heavy inertial loads is presented. The limitations imposed by a linear formulation of elasticity are overcome by a second order expansion of the displacement field, based on a geometrical exact beam model. In light of this, the nonlinearities of the elastic terms are shifted as inertial contributions, which yields an expression of the equations of motion in closed form. Thanks to the formulation in closed form, the proposed model is implemented in Modelica, with particular care to the suitability of the model with respect to the Modelica Multibody library.
After describing the model formulation and implementation, the paper presents some simulation results, in order to validate the model with respect to benchmarks, widely adopted in literature.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> Musculoskeletal Modeling of the Hand and Contact Object in Modelica </i> <br />
<b>Authors:</b> <a href="../authors/author_262.html">Shashank Swaminathan</a> and <a href="../authors/author_6.html">Johan Andreasson</a><br />
<b>Abstract:</b>The paper's primary goal is to develop a mathematical
model that could be used towards the development and
improvement of orthotic assist gloves. The model is
constructed using component based modeling in the
object-oriented declarative language Modelica,
specifically the MultiBody Modelica library. Multiple
hand models currently do exist; however, they are
mainly causal, and require separate development and
validation of mathematical solvers before use. By using
Modelica, the model is constructed from the system’s
physical equations, thereby relieving issues regarding
validity of the model’s computational equations; the
acausality inherent in Modelica allows for more model
development that more closely mirrors relations in the
physical world. The model is scoped to be able to model
the kinematics and dynamics of the hand when grasping
a spherical object – both bone structure and muscle
geometry and actuation are simplifications based off
anatomy literature. The contact model is developed as a
separate component from the hand system. The main
design goal of the contact model is to represent the
characteristics of a relatively rigid object that still
maintains a degree of friction and pliability on the
surface layer.
The main two grasps tested in the paper are the
prehensile and precision grasps (powerful and dexterous
grasps). The muscle actuation profiles per each finger
are adjusted until the desired dynamic profile is
achieved for each type of grasp. The main data points of
interests are the joint angles and contact forces for each
finger. Further validation of the model is done using the
animation automatically generated by the tool. Testing
results indicate that the model can successfully simulate
contractions at all levels of abstraction of the hand’s
components (basic bone-joint components, finger
components, and the overall hand system). The results
also indicate that both prehensile and precision grasps
are possible, given appropriate muscle actuation and
finger orientation parameter values.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> Modelica Spur Gears with Hertzian Contact Forces </i> <br />
<b>Authors:</b> <a href="../authors/author_53.html">Markus Dahl</a>, <a href="../authors/author_299.html">Håkan Wettergren</a> and <a href="../authors/author_274.html">Henrik Tidefelt</a><br />
<b>Abstract:</b>To be able to capture the dynamics of entire systems is one of the strengths of the Modelica language. This article will examine the possibility of modeling spur gears in the Modelica environment Wolfram SystemModeler, and integrating them with other rotating machinery elements, such as roller bearings and flexible shafts. The contact forces between spur gears are based on the Hertzian Theory of Contact.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> Modeling of Roller Bearings </i> <br />
<b>Authors:</b> <a href="../authors/author_296.html">Tobias Weiser</a> and <a href="../authors/author_49.html">Burkhard Corves</a><br />
<b>Abstract:</b>Modeling of multibody mechanics plays a central role in
the design of mechatronic systems. Roller Bearings contribute
stiffness and damping to the system dynamics of
a mechatronic system. This article shows the stiffness
modeling of a few roller bearing types. The kinematics
of deformation of a roller bearing are shown. Based on
the principle of Hertz contact stress the elastic forces and
torques are calculated. These forces are considered and
implemented in the Multi-Body-System Library.<br />
