<b>Abstract:</b>Performance and range optimization of electric vehicles are challenging targets in the design of contemporary automobiles. This paper illustrates that key factors in achieving these targets are the thermal system and the development of the related control logic. Both subjects benefit from the support of modeling and simulation. The paper describes our approach applied to a real case study.
The activity is the result of cooperation between Dallara, responsible for the case study, and Modelon, developers of the libraries used to build the simulation model.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> Investigating the Effect of a Sonic Restrictor in the Intake of an Engine </i> <br />

<b>Abstract:</b>The air induction system is one of the engine subsystems that most influences fuel efficiency and power generation, especially in restricted race engine applications.
In this paper, the quasi-1D model of a sonic restrictor is presented, together with its integration in an engine model, in order to investigate the behaviour of the engine power and torque when the choked condition is reached. 
The study shows how power and torque curves are affected when a sonic restrictor is installed within the intake system and outlines the need of detailed simulations in a restricted engine development process, to avoid steep engine power reductions at high speeds.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> Engine thermal shock testing prediction through coolant and lubricant cycling in Dymola </i> <br />
<b>Authors:</b> <a href="../authors/author_215.html">Alessandro Picarelli</a>, <a href="../authors/author_78.html">Eduardo Galindo</a> and <a href="../authors/author_254.html">Rodolfo Soler</a><br />
<b>Abstract:</b>In this work, an acausal multi-domain physical system model is used to study the interaction between an internal combustion engine operation and a range of cooling and lubrication system thermal cycling scenarios. Although the model can be used for modelling a wide range of scenarios, this paper concentrates on the application of engine thermal shock test dynamics prediction through coolant and lubricant cycling. An internal combustion engine is load-controlled on a dynamometer. Coolant and lubricant temperature transients are imposed on the engine system. Using freely available and commercial Modelica Libraries within the Dymola environment, the systems integration of the coolant rigs, lubricant rigs and engine is achieved. The rigs and the controllers are validated against test data to create predictive models of such systems for test virtualisation. This allows the user to develop and define control strategies for the tests from desktop, prior to engaging in laboratory tests.<br />
