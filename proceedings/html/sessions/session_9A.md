<b>Abstract:</b>The Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) is more and more adopted by industrial users, increasing the pressure for higher quality and standard compliance of FMI supporting tools. The FMI cross check infrastructure was created to support tool vendors in their quest for quality improvements and to give users some measure of confidence in the tool quality. Currently it is up to the tool vendors which FMUs to submit there and therefore the features tested in the FMI cross check is incomplete and interpretation of failures is difficult. While for FMI export there is the FMU compliance checker to test a wide variety of FMI features, no means are available today to prove standard compliance for FMI import. This will be overcome by adding reference FMUs to the FMI cross check, testing specific features of the FMI standard for standard compliance and giving detailed feedback, if an importing tool violates the standard. The paper describes the realization and the importance of reference FMUs.<br />

<b>Abstract:</b>The "Embedded Simulation via FMI" is a new modeling approach which allows for efficient and fast computation of systems with a clear separation of time axis or time
scale. For its application the so-called "inner model" is wrapped into an FMU and embedded into an outer model, whose dynamics control the integration. The computation
of the embedded model is only utilized on demand. In this way the "Embedded Simulation via FMI" uses the Functional Mock-up Interface for Co-Simulation in a different way than it was provided for. The functionality has been realized within SimulationX prototypically. It is applied to the simulation of the lifetime test of a linear stepper motor including wear in the screw drive, for which the axial play after several monthsâ€™ runtime shall be determined. A significant reduction of computing time while preserving considerable accuracy can be shown.<br />

<b>Abstract:</b>Delight Design Platform Project is the project managed by The University of Tokyo as one of the projects included in the Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Program (SIP) which is organized by Cabinet Office, Government of Japan. In this project, 1DCAE tool is recommended as a design tool in the concept phase of the product development. In the Delight Design Platform the concept of the new product is simulated with 1DCAE model and evaluated. Prototyping a tool for translating the concept to 3D model is one of the objectives of the project. This paper describes a method of the integration Modelica with 3D digital mockup (DMU) tool. The prototype is implemented as an extension of the XVL Studio which is one of the most popular DMU tools provided by Lattice Technology Co.,Ltd. The integration is realized by the technology of FMI (Functional Mockup Interface).<br />
