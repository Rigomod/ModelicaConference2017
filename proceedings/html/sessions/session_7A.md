<b>Abstract:</b>Applying light-weight construction methods to the design of future electric vehicles results in weight reduction of both the vehicle body and the chassis. However, the potential for percental reduction of the sprung mass is larger compared to that of the un¬sprung mass. Consequently, unfavorable consequences on the compromise, which always needs to be found between road contact and road holding, can arise. This requires additional arrangements in order to reach the performance of a state-of-the-art conventional vehicle. This paper presents a possible design solution. The wheel carrier is split into two parts, thus enabling to tune the frequency response correspondingly to reference vehicles. Besides the technical solution the Modelica modeling of the proposed suspension system as well as a vehicle dynamics and ride comfort assessment are presented.<br />

<b>Abstract:</b>This thesis gives a description on the study to develop the framework of commercial vehicle design based on the target cascading. Design framework consists of modeler, simulation, and performance index calculation module. The modeler has been developed based on Excel for the general designers with no idea of the vehicle dynamics to easily use the commercial vehicle model library that has the hierarchical structure. The model library with hierarchical structure was created based upon Modelica, and developed in order to interlock the model factors and design factors between hierarchs to fit design process. Simulation module is a module that automatically makes a simulation with the model created in modeler module if a user defines a scenario. Lastly, performance index calculation module is a module that makes the result of simulation into performance index. To check the effectiveness of the developed framework, we applied it to the design matters of suspension system in the consideration of the performance improvement of R&H. We confirmed from the result of design that performance enhanced by 15% and time for design decreased more than 50% as well. These results indicate that the developed framework is suitable for the design process for suspension system of target cascading.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> Model Based Analysis of Shimmy in a Racing Bicycle </i> <br />

<b>Abstract:</b>In this paper we are presenting a model of a racing bicycle, developed in Modelica language within the Dymola environment. The main purpose is to investigate the dynamic response of the bicycle and its modes of vibration, referring in particular to shimmy. This phenomenon occurs at high speeds and consists of sudden oscillations of the front assembly around the steering axis. Lateral accelerations on the horizontal tube of the frame can reach 5-10 g with a frequency that varies between 5-10 Hz. Even if it is quite uncommon, shimmy is a topic of great relevance, because it may be extremely dangerous for the rider. Thanks to this model, we can show that the main elements which contribute to the rise of the oscillations are the lateral compliance of the frame and the tyres’ deformation.<br />
