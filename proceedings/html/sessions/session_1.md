<b>Title:</b> <i> Challenges of Future Robotics </i> <br />
<b>Authors:</b> <a href="../authors/author_158.html">Bernd Liepert</a><br />
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>Robotics will change the world! It will unleash the
same if not an even more disruptive and transformational
power within the next 50 years as mainstream IT-technology
and the Internet have over the last half a century. Nurtured by
technological breakthroughs in industrial automation, robotics
will exhaustively permeate all domains of the human living
realm. Hence, our grandchildren will grow up in a society that
is enriched and enhanced by assistive technologies in every
imaginable way. Robotics and automation will be tailored into
many everyday objects, becoming an integral part of all kinds
of appliances. This Generation 'R' will be without fear of these
technologies perceiving their beneficial nature - they will grow up
as Robotic Natives. This implies, that today's people are already
born to become the first society of Robotic Immigrants. Although
it is not possible to precisely predict the world of tomorrow,
the presented model of the 4 Robotic Revolutions provides a
compelling, holistic approach to describe the future phases
of robotic evolution, characterizing them according to their
technological enablers and underlying interaction paradigms.
