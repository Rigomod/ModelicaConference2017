<b>Abstract:</b>This paper belongs to a long-term research activity on modelling and simulation of large grids in Modelica, and specifically with the OpenModelica translator. We describe the present state of the research, its evolution over the last year, the conclusions we could reach in this period in comparison with the initial hypotheses, and some results. As a consequence, we outline the future of the presented activity.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> A Modelica-based Tool for Power System Dynamic Simulations </i> <br />
<b>Authors:</b> <a href="../authors/author_155.html">Gladys E. Leon</a>, <a href="../authors/author_22.html">Francois P. Beaude</a> and <a href="../authors/author_110.html">Jean-Baptiste Heyberger</a><br />
<b>Abstract:</b>Developments made during the EU FP7 funded project iTesla towards automatic ways of transforming powers systems from proprietary format to Modelica, served as a proof of concept for the adoption of Modelica as a common and standardized language for power system modelling and simulation. This work is a continuation of the progresses made during the iTesla. This paper presents a Modelica-based tool developed with the main purpose of providing users with an easy way to generate power system networks in Modelica and perform time-domain simulations. The tool is validated by generating Modelica systems for IEEE cases and comparing simulation outputs with a reference tool (Eurostag).<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> A Modelica VSC-HVDC Average Value Model Implementation and its Software-to-Software Validation using an EMT Power System Domain Specific Simulator </i> <br />
<b>Authors:</b> <a href="../authors/author_2.html">Mohammed Ahsan Adib Murad</a> and <a href="../authors/author_286.html">Luigi Vanfretti</a><br />
<b>Abstract:</b>This paper reports the implementation of a three-phase VSC-HVDC model using the Modelica language. The model is suitable for power system simulation where the power electronic circuitry can be represented using equivalent voltage and current sources to model the high frequency switching process. Differently from the authors previous work, this model is built using as much components as possible from the MSL (Modelica Standard Library) to represent the three phase electrical circuit, while implementing the de facto control system models used within typical power system simulation tools. To show the applicability of Modelica for modeling an VSC-HVDC, a software-to-software validation is performed using the EMTP-RV power system simulator.<br />
