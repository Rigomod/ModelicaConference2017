<h2>Proceedings</h2>
<p>The 12th International Modelica Conference,
which takes place at Clarion Congress Hotel Prague,
is the main event for the Modelica
community. Users, library developers, tool vendors, and
language designers gather to share their knowledge
and learn about the latest scientific and industrial
progress related to Modelica and FMI (Functional
Mockup Interface).</p>

<p>The fundamental idea behind Modelica is to allow
storing modeling know-how in a high-level formally
defined format, i.e., to collect information which
you otherwise would find in engineering books only
accessible by humans. By allowing convenient reuse
of this know-how by definition of component model
libraries, enormous saving in man-hours for setting up
simulation studies is achieved. Furthermore, by proper
validation of such model libraries, much more reliable
conclusions can be made from simulation studies
leading to better products and user experience.
These considerations lead to the equation-based
object-oriented formalism of Modelica.</p>

<p>Since the start of the collaborative design work for
Modelica in 1996, Modelica has matured from an idea
among a small number of dedicated enthusiasts to a
widely accepted standard language for the modeling
and simulation of cyber-physical systems. In addition,
the standardization of the language by the non-profit
organization Modelica Association enables Modelica
models to be portable between a growing number
of commercial and open-source tools. Modelica
is now used in many industries including automotive,
process and energy, aerospace, robotics,
and industrial equipment. Modelica is the language of
choice for model-based systems engineering.</p>

<p>The FMI standard has been added to the project
portfolio of the Modelica Association. FMI provides
a complementary open standard that enables deployment
of pre-compiled high quality models originating
from different model formats to a larger number of
engineers working with system design and verification.</p>

<p>The format of the conference features a first day with 9
tutorials and 9 vendor presentations, as well as the FMI User Meeting.
The following two days are exclusively dedicated to the scientific program.</p>

<p>The program is available in an event app for smartphones and
tablets running Android and iOS, as well as accessible online with
any web browser. After the conference, the proceedings will be officially
published by Linköping University Electronic Press.</p>

<p>The conference site is located right above the Vysočanská station of
the underground, which takes you to all the city center attractions in
less than 20 minutes.</p>

<ul>
<li>2 Keynote speeches</li>
