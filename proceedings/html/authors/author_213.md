<b>Abstract:</b>Despite the accepted fact that control logic deployed in
future and existing buildings through building automation
systems constitutes a key factor for increasing their energy
efficiency, the support for modelling and simulation
of these in current state-of-the-art simulation tools and libraries
is rather limited. In particular a gap exists for modelling
and simulation of standardised control functions. In
this work we present an approach for modelling standardised
control logic using Modelica. We evaluated the interoperability
of the modelling approach by simulating a test
case of an automation solution controlling the sunshade of
a room and by reimplementing a state-based control for an
air handling unit reusing models from two Annex60 compliant
libraries.<br />
