<b>Abstract:</b>The paper deals with optimal control problems defined
for hybrid systems described by higher index DAEs. We
present a prototype solution that supports the whole process
from defining such problem to solving it and presenting
results. Problem’s definition is done with Dynamic
Optimization Modeling Language (DOML) which
is based directly on Modelica. The proposed numerical
procedure for solving the problems of interest has the following
features: 1) it is based on the appropriately defined
adjoint equations formulated for the discretized equations
being the result of the numerical integration of system
equations by an implicit Runge–Kutta method; 2) initialization
for higher index DAEs is performed with the help
of Pantelides’ algorithm; 3) it does not require the system
to be transformed to ODEs (through differentiation of
some algebraic equations).
The paper presents numerical examples related to hybrid
systems described by index three DAEs, showing the
validity of the proposed approach. All software components
needed to carry out the computations, i.e. the code
editor, compiler, numerical libraries and GUI for presenting
results are prepared as parts of a combined platform:
Interactive Dynamic Optimization Server (IDOS).<br />
