<b>Title:</b> <i> Modelling and Simulation of the passive Structure of a 5-Axis-Milling Machine with rigid and flexible bodies for evaluating the static and dynamic behaviour </i> <br />

<b>Abstract:</b>Most of the mechanical simulations for industrial usage are done by finite element (FE-) analysis. Milling machines are mechatronic systems, combining electrical, mechanical and control components for machining certain materials. Modelica provides a powerful and strong tool to simulate different physical ares in one model. For this usage a mechanical model of a 5-Axis-Milling Machine is implemented with rigid and flexible bodies. Specific attention will be paid to which components can be modelled rigid without significant deviation in accordance to the real behaviour of the machine. Two classes of implementing flexible bodies in multi body systems are given by the flexible bodies Library, advantages and disadvantages of both classes will be evaluated. At the end a comparision of the static and dynamic behaviour of the passive structure of the model in contrast to a FE-analysis is given.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> EMOTH The EMobility Library of OTH Regensburg </i> <br />
<b>Authors:</b> <a href="../authors/author_95.html">Alexander Grimm</a> and <a href="../authors/author_102.html">Anton Haumer</a><br />
<b>Abstract:</b>The importance of E-Mobility is rapidly increasing, not only for private vehicle traffic but also for public transport. In and around Regensburg, Germany there are a lot of automotive companies. Therefore E-Mobility is an important topic in the curriculum of several courses of study at the East-Bavarian Technical University of Applied Sciences Regensburg (OTH).
One Master of Applied Research student at OTH has chosen the topic to develop an open-source simulation tool for electric vehicles – the EMOTH Library – based on Modelica and to refine several aspects of the library during the one and a half year of the master course.
After one semester, the basic version of the library is available and will be presented in this paper.<br />
