<b>Abstract:</b>We discuss the application of the FMI Co-Simulation technology to building energy performance simulation, where detailed physical building models are coupled to Modelica-based HVAC component and plant models. First, we describe the generation process of the building FMU from our stand-alone building simulation program NANDRAD and sketch out internal algorithms for FMI version 2 capabilities. Then, coupling scenarios are described and physical interface conventions are presented. Usability is addressed by automatic generation of building-model specific adapters and wrappers. The building FMU and plant FMUs are then simulated together using different Co-Simulation master algorithms. Finally, based on simulation results and performance analysis we conclude with recommendations on suitable master algorithm options and specific features of suitable building FMUs.<br />
