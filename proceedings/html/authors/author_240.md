<b>Abstract:</b>This paper presents an optimization of the start-up process of a post-combustion carbon capture plant (PCC-plant) by varying the solvent flow rate. In a first optimization run the start-up time is minimized. In a second optimization run the overall carbon capture rate during the start-up process is maximized. The results show the great potential of the optimization, as the start-up time can be reduced from t=4650 seconds in the reference case to t=2840 seconds in the optimized scenario.<br />
