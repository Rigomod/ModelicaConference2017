<b>Abstract:</b>Two dynamic models of fixed bed regenerators for metallic and ceramic configurations have been developed in Modelica. These models have been both worked out within CAPTURE European project and will serve as design tool for a fixed bed regenerative heat exchange system. The present article describes in detail both models and presents a case study that compares experimental and simulation results for the testing of a ceramic honeycomb regenerative matrix.<br />
