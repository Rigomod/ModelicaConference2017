<b>Abstract:</b>This paper presents a generalized multirotor aerial vehicle (MAV) modeling framework which includes rigid body dynamics, gyroscopic effects and motor dynamics. We illustrate how this model can be used to derive any MAV platform constructed with an arbitrary number of rotors by using the quadrotor case as an example. Based on this result, we design the first Modelica-based MAV simulator. We validate the proposed design by using a simple altitude and attitude stabilization control system through a Modelica simulation setup.<br />
