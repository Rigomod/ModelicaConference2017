<b>Abstract:</b>This paper belongs to a long-term research activity on modelling and simulation of large grids in Modelica, and specifically with the OpenModelica translator. We describe the present state of the research, its evolution over the last year, the conclusions we could reach in this period in comparison with the initial hypotheses, and some results. As a consequence, we outline the future of the presented activity.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> Using Modelica for advanced Multi-Body modelling in 3D graphical robotic simulators </i> <br />
<b>Authors:</b> <a href="../authors/author_13.html">Gianluca Bardaro</a>, <a href="../authors/author_16.html">Luca Bascetta</a>, <a href="../authors/author_41.html">Francesco Casella</a> and <a href="../authors/author_174.html">Matteo Matteucci</a><br />
<b>Abstract:</b>This paper describes a framework to extend the 3D robotic simulation environment Gazebo, and similar ones, with enhanced, tailor-made, multi-body dynamics specified in the Modelica language. The body-to-body interaction models are written in Modelica, but they use the sophisticated collision detection capabilities of the Gazebo engine. This contribution is a first step toward the simulation of complex robotics systems integrating detailed physics modelling and realistic sensors such as lidar and cameras. A proof-of-concept implementation is described in the paper integrating Gazebo collider and the Modelica MultiBody library, and the results obtained when simulating the interaction of an elastic sphere with a rigid plane are shown.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> Solving large-scale Modelica models: new approaches and experimental results using OpenModelica </i> <br />

<b>Abstract:</b>Modelica-based modeling and simulation is becoming increasingly important for the development of high quality engineering products. Therefore, the system size of interest in a Modelica-based simulation is continously increasing and the traditional way of generating simulation code, e.g. involving symbolic transformations like matching, sorting, and tearing, must be adapted to this situation.
This paper describes recently implemented sparse solver techniques in OpenModelica in order to efficiently compile and simulate large-scale Modelica models. A proof
of concept is given by evaluating the performance of selected benchmark problems.<br />
