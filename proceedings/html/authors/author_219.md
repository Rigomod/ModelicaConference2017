<b>Abstract:</b>The air in aircraft cabins is controlled for pressure, temperature and humidity. The number of temperature zones is generally kept low, for reasons of necessary ducting space. We devise a new ducting concept, which enables a large number of temperature zones. Controllability of the system is however predicted to be a potential obstacle.
For a quick resolution of this question, a Modelica model is created.
Model creation is focused on a short development time as well as usefulness for controller synthesis. A workflow is presented that enables a quick iteration time between controller synthesis in Matlab and controller testing in a Modelica environment. Finally, the impact of this new concept on the energy consumption of the air generation unit is discussed.<br />
