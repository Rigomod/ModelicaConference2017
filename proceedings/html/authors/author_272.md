<b>Abstract:</b>This contribution describes an approach for a template based code generation for different detailed Modelica models for building energy simulation (BES). 
The information from several data sources, which describe the building geometry, the building construction, the building location and the building itself, is used to fill a building data model. This intermediate data structure is still independent of a certain building simulation tool. 
A new developed tool for template based code generation (CoTeTo) uses the building data model and combines it with a set of different code generators, which are able to generate Modelica building models with a different level of detail: Strong simplified low-order building models for district energy simulation with a large population of buildings, more advanced multi-zone building models for building energy simulation and 3D space resolved room models for a detailed indoor climate analysis.
Three case studies for the mentioned building model types demonstrate the code generation approach.<br />
