<b>Title:</b> <i> Synchronous Programming and its fit with Modeling </i> <br />

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>The family of Synchronous programming languages
was born in the 1980's in three different French labs that gathered
researchers in Computer Science and Control Theory. The three
first languages were Esterel, dedicated to control-dominated
problems in embedded systems, telecom protocols and later
digital circuit design, Lustre, dedicated to continuous control, and
Signal, oriented towards signal processing. They share a common
perfect synchrony principle that expresses that the reaction to
an input should be viewed as conceptually instantaneous. This
simple principle is well-adapted to the targeted applications
and greatly simplifies programming by reconciling parallelism
and determinism. It also leads to well-defined mathematical
semantics that directly ground their formal compiling, simulation
and verification environments. Synchronous programming
rapidly became used in Industry for safety-critical production
systems in avionics (Dassault Aviation, Airbus, etc.), railways, etc.,
as well as in robotics and circuit design. In the 2000's, Esterel
and Lustre have been unified in two new languages industrialized
by Esterel Technologies (now part of Ansys): SCADE 6 for safety
critical software and Esterel v7 for hardware design, both also
incorporating ideas from Harel's reactive graphical formalism
Statecharts.

The talk will explain the practical and mathematical concepts
of synchronous programming and stress its advantages over
asynchronous concurrent programming for the considered
applications. It will also explore the links between synchronous
programming and modeling / simulation. In one direction,
synchronous languages are ideal targets to generate embedded
code from executable parts of simulation models. In the other
direction, embedding synchrony into conventional modelers
may be necessary to solve the current tricky issues due to the
coupling of discrete and continuous computations in modelers,
in particular for the currently mishandled case where external
or internal events provoke cascades of discrete reactions. Pouzet
and Bourkes's new Zelus language is a step in this direction.
