<b>Abstract:</b>A common situation in industry is that a system model is composed of several sub-models which may have been developed using different tools. The quality and effectiveness of large scale system modeling heavily depends on the underlying tools used for different phases of the development lifecycle. Available modeling and simulation tools support different operations on models, such as model creation, model simulation, FMU export, model checking, and code generation. Seamless tracing of the requirements and associating them with the models and the simulation results in the context of different modeling tools is becoming increasingly important. This can be used to support several activities such as impact analysis, component reuse, verification, and validation. However, due to the lack of interoperability between tools it is often difficult to use such tools in combination. Recently, the OSLC specification has emerged for integrating different lifecycle tools using linked data. In this paper we present new work on traceability support in OpenModelica where the traceability information is exchanged with other lifecycle tools through a standardized interface and format using OSLC. In particular, OpenModelica supports automatic recording and tracing of modeling activities such as creation, modification, and destruction of models, import model description XML, export of FMUs, and creation of simulation results.<br />

<b>Abstract:</b>The step-by-step self-teaching approach through audio-video
  tutorials, known as Spoken Tutorials, has been very successful.
  About 3.4 million students in India have taken at least one course
  during the past 6-year period, of which 1.6 million students have
  attended the rapidly expanding course programme during 2016. This
  programme has now been expanded by a newly developed course in
  Modeling and Simulation with Modelica using the OpenModelica open
  source tool, primarily via the OMEdit graphical user interface. The
  spoken tutorial programme is exclusively based on free and open
  source software. This paper gives an introduction to the spoken
  tutorial approach and presents the recently developed spoken
  tutorial series for Modelica using OpenModelica.  Feedback of
  participants shows that this series is an effective tool for
  self-learning of OpenModelica.  The paper also presents a new web
  version that generalises the interactive DrModelica course material,
  OMWebbook:  it enables students to learn Modelica, do text-based
  modeling exercises, and run simulations without needing to install a
  Modelica tool. OMWebbook is also planned to be covered in a future
  update to the spoken tutorial course on Modelica.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> Development of a Thermodynamic Engine in OpenModelica </i> <br />
<b>Authors:</b> <a href="../authors/author_122.html">Rahul Jain</a>, <a href="../authors/author_184.html">Kannan Moudgalya</a>, <a href="../authors/author_76.html">Peter Fritzson</a> and <a href="../authors/author_221.html">Adrian Pop</a><br />
<b>Abstract:</b>OpenModelica, an open source equation oriented modeling environment
  for steady state and dynamic simulation, lacks good chemical
  engineering support.  This problem is addressed by making available
  in different ways the thermodynamic library Chemsep that comes with
  DWSIM, an open source sequential modular steady state simulator.
  Only slow speeds could be achieved through a Python-C API based
  interface connecting OpenModelica with the thermodynamic library.  A
  socket programming based interface helps achieve faster speeds.
  Best results have been achieved by porting the thermodynamic library
  and the calculation routines to OpenModelica, due to two reasons:
  (1) thermodynamic equations are solved simultaneously with mass and
  energy balances (2) overheads in calling the external routines of
  DWSIM are eliminated.  Performances of the above mentioned three
  approaches have been validated with steady state and dynamic
  simulations.  Benzene - toluene separation, methanol - ethanol -
  water distillation, and steam distillation of an n-octane - n-decane
  mixture, have been carried out through these simulations.  This work
  makes available a powerful simulation platform to the chemical
  engineering.<br />
