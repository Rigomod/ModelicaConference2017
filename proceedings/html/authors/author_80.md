<b>Abstract:</b>The air induction system is one of the engine subsystems that most influences fuel efficiency and power generation, especially in restricted race engine applications.
In this paper, the quasi-1D model of a sonic restrictor is presented, together with its integration in an engine model, in order to investigate the behaviour of the engine power and torque when the choked condition is reached. 
The study shows how power and torque curves are affected when a sonic restrictor is installed within the intake system and outlines the need of detailed simulations in a restricted engine development process, to avoid steep engine power reductions at high speeds.<br />
