<b>Abstract:</b>To be able to capture the dynamics of entire systems is one of the strengths of the Modelica language. This article will examine the possibility of modeling spur gears in the Modelica environment Wolfram SystemModeler, and integrating them with other rotating machinery elements, such as roller bearings and flexible shafts. The contact forces between spur gears are based on the Hertzian Theory of Contact.<br />
