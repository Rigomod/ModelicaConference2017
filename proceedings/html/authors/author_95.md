<b>Abstract:</b>The importance of E-Mobility is rapidly increasing, not only for private vehicle traffic but also for public transport. In and around Regensburg, Germany there are a lot of automotive companies. Therefore E-Mobility is an important topic in the curriculum of several courses of study at the East-Bavarian Technical University of Applied Sciences Regensburg (OTH).
One Master of Applied Research student at OTH has chosen the topic to develop an open-source simulation tool for electric vehicles – the EMOTH Library – based on Modelica and to refine several aspects of the library during the one and a half year of the master course.
After one semester, the basic version of the library is available and will be presented in this paper.<br />
