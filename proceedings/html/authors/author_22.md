<b>Abstract:</b>Developments made during the EU FP7 funded project iTesla towards automatic ways of transforming powers systems from proprietary format to Modelica, served as a proof of concept for the adoption of Modelica as a common and standardized language for power system modelling and simulation. This work is a continuation of the progresses made during the iTesla. This paper presents a Modelica-based tool developed with the main purpose of providing users with an easy way to generate power system networks in Modelica and perform time-domain simulations. The tool is validated by generating Modelica systems for IEEE cases and comparing simulation outputs with a reference tool (Eurostag).<br />
