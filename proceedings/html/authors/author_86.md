<b>Abstract:</b>To build a full vehicle model entirely based on physical
equations is a challenge. To have this model to run fast
enough so that it is suitable for Hardware-in-the-Loop testing
is even more challenging. The level of detail in the physical
representation of the vehicle can always be increased at the
cost of simulation time. Even if the performance of the
hardware is constantly improving, we still have to
compromise.
As part of the MORSE (MOdel based Real-time Systems
Engineering) project, model reduction techniques are
developed and applied to a vehicle model. The results in
terms of accuracy and simulation speed are then investigated.<br />
