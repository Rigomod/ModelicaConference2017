<b>Abstract:</b>Boiling in vertical and horizontal pipes is a complex process defining transient and static performance of various technical applications. An extensive literature review taking all relevant boiling regimes is presented. The models from the literature are evaluated with respect to accuracy and suitability for system simulation application. A set of sub-models for each of the existing boiling phenomena is implemented and applied to a global boiling model. The work pays special attention to smooth transition between the sub-models and to numerical efficient solutions with respect to the consideration of the boiling crisis.<br />
