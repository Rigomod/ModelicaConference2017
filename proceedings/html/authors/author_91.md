<b>Abstract:</b>A Nuclear Hybrid Energy System (NHES) uses a nuclear reactor as the basic power generation unit. The power generated is then used by multiple customers as either thermal power, electrical power, or both. The definition and architecture of an NHES can be adapted based on the needs and opportunities of a given local market. For example, locations in need of potable water may be best served by coupling a desalination plant to the NHES. Similarly, a location near an oil refinery may have a need for emission-free hydrogen production. Using the flexible, multi-domain capabilities of Modelica, Argonne National Laboratory, Idaho National Laboratory (INL), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) are investigating the dynamics (e.g., thermal hydraulics and electrical generation/consumption) and cost of such a hybrid system. This paper examines ongoing NHES work including the modeling organizational layout, highlighting a few subsystems, describing some of the component development and providing results from a study of multi-dimensional conduction model development.<br />
