<b>Abstract:</b>In this paper we present a new library for co-simulation of
discrete element method and modelica models. For this a
component-based approach is used which allows closed
modeling and visualization of discrete element systems
in a modelica tool. Translation into a native DEM description
language and co-simulation is done by a separate
compiler and backend. Usage and functionality are shown
in a simple use case of a bucket excavator digging a hole.<br />
