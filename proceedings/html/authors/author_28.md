<b>Abstract:</b>The Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) is more and more adopted by industrial users, increasing the pressure for higher quality and standard compliance of FMI supporting tools. The FMI cross check infrastructure was created to support tool vendors in their quest for quality improvements and to give users some measure of confidence in the tool quality. Currently it is up to the tool vendors which FMUs to submit there and therefore the features tested in the FMI cross check is incomplete and interpretation of failures is difficult. While for FMI export there is the FMU compliance checker to test a wide variety of FMI features, no means are available today to prove standard compliance for FMI import. This will be overcome by adding reference FMUs to the FMI cross check, testing specific features of the FMI standard for standard compliance and giving detailed feedback, if an importing tool violates the standard. The paper describes the realization and the importance of reference FMUs.<br />
