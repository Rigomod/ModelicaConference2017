<b>Abstract:</b>Modeling of multibody mechanics plays a central role in
the design of mechatronic systems. Roller Bearings contribute
stiffness and damping to the system dynamics of
a mechatronic system. This article shows the stiffness
modeling of a few roller bearing types. The kinematics
of deformation of a roller bearing are shown. Based on
the principle of Hertz contact stress the elastic forces and
torques are calculated. These forces are considered and
implemented in the Multi-Body-System Library.<br />
