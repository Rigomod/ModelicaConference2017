<b>Abstract:</b>Performance and range optimization of electric vehicles are challenging targets in the design of contemporary automobiles. This paper illustrates that key factors in achieving these targets are the thermal system and the development of the related control logic. Both subjects benefit from the support of modeling and simulation. The paper describes our approach applied to a real case study.
The activity is the result of cooperation between Dallara, responsible for the case study, and Modelon, developers of the libraries used to build the simulation model.<br />
