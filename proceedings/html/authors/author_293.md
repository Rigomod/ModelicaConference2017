<b>Abstract:</b>User experience is an eminent part of holistic product design.
Especially in the field of mobile machinery, the
driver’s impression of the machine handling is crucial for
successful design. To get an early understanding of the ergonomic
aspects of a new concept of operation, interactive
simulation can be applied. This paper presents the tools
to develop a functional prototype using free software and
low-cost hardware. This includes prototyping of control
devices, interfaces to the simulation models and a generic
visualization using a game engine. In order to speed up the
process of functional prototyping, an approach to automatically
visualizing FMUs based on a scene description file
is presented. The application of interactive simulation was
used to support the development of a novel control device
for excavators in a student project at TU Dresden.<br />

<b>Abstract:</b>There are many cases where simulation applications need to interact with their environment. Typical examples are Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) simulators (including flight, driving, and marine training simulators), Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulators, but also offline process simulators which cannot operate in a completely self-contained manner and therefore need to be coupled to external applications. Embedded control applications are another related area which requires that applications interact with their environment. The Modelica_DeviceDrivers library, which had its first release as open-source library in 2012, tries to cater for such use cases. This paper describes the library for the first time and reports about the numerous challenges that the project experienced to meet its goal of supporting several platforms and tools within a standard-conform, platform-generic, feature-rich, and easy-to-use Modelica library.<br />
