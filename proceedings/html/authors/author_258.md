<b>Abstract:</b>A variable-structure model (VSM) of a battery electric vehicle used for simulating the ageing of the battery pack is presented. The operating principle of the software used to simulate the models is described and a brief summary of the state of science and technology regarding the simulation of VSMs is given. By comparing the performance of the VSM to a conventional model, it is found that the simulation time does not necessarily decrease when replacing a model with a variable-structure version. However, the VSM has advantages regarding the handling of the result files and the possibility to analyse the results.<br />
