<b>Abstract:</b>This paper presents the current state of the open-source Modelica library \ClaRa which enables the user to solve complex power plant simulation tasks. The library can be used to help control experts to develop and test controllers without disturbing the daily operation of the applying power plant. This reduces projects risks and costs significantly. As a use case the analysis and optimisation of a Benson boiler power control is presented. The presented solution reduces the impact of soot blowing on the power output by  57~\%.<br />
