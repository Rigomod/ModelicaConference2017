<b>Abstract:</b>The Jet Propulsion Library provides a foundation for modeling and simulation of jet engines, and the model-based design of integrated aircraft systems. It provides a fully rigorous foundation for sizing and performance computations, and provides a number of advantages over existing domain-specific solutions due to the use of the Modelica language. This paper provides an introduction and overview of the new library and describes an application in the design of a turbo fan engine.<br />
