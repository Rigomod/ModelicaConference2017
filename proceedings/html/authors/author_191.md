<b>Abstract:</b>There exist several specialized tools that provide environments for the development and simulation of either pure Modelica models or pure signal based models. These  environments have each their own advantages and flaws.
  solidThinking Activate\tm/ has been developed to mix these domains and take advantage of  both of these approaches to system modeling.
  This paper presents this mixed Signal-Modelica environment, and in particular the efforts and challenges faced in its development.<br />
