<b>Abstract:</b>There is a strong focus on new renewable energy sources,
such as, solar power, wind energy and biomass, in the con-
text of reducing carbon emissions. Because of its maturity,
hydropower is often overlooked. However, there is an era
of hydro oriented research in improving many aspects of
this well established technology.
Representing a physical system of a hydropower plant
by mathematical models can serve as a powerful tool for
analysing and predicting the system performance during
disturbances. Furthermore it can create opportunities in
investigating more advanced control method.
A simulation model of a reference hydropower station
located in northwest of Iceland was implemented using
the modelling language Modelica. The main simulation
scenarios of interest were: 20 % load rejection, worst-case
scenario of full shut-down and pressure rise in the pressure
shaft due to the water hammer effect. This paper will show
that the different simulation scenarios were successfully
carried out based on the given the data available of the
Fossárvirkjun power plant. The load rejection simulation
gave expected results and was verified against a reference
results from manufacturer.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> modelica.university: A Platform for Interactive Modelica Content </i> <br />

<b>Abstract:</b>The web was conceived of as a medium for the expression and
  exploration of scientific and engineering ideas.  However, observing
  the actual content on the web, an alien race might presume that the
  primary impetus for web technologies was the dessimention of cat
  videos or celebrity gossip. Fundamentally, HTML and HTTP are
  certainly sufficient for the creation of scientific and engineering
  content just as they are for the creation of online magazines and
  websites.  But while a number of "content management systems" have
  been created to facilitate the publication of prose, there are very
  few such tools that cater to making it easy to create scientific and
  engineering content.

  In this paper, we will present a platform which can be thought of as
  a content management system for scientific and engineering content.
  We will start by describing what we believe to be the fundamental
  requirements for such a system.  From there, we will discuss two
  different applications built on this platform.  The first is an
  interactive tutorial for teaching the basics of the Modelica
  languages and the other is an example application that involves
  creating interactive content for use in an engineering course on
  hydro-electric power generation.  This content will be published on
  the modelica.university domain and we invite others to
  contribute additional content to the site.<br />
