<b>Abstract:</b>This paper introduces a new algorithm to increase the simulation performance of algebraic equation systems by encapsulating function calls. This avoids all unnecessary  evaluations of function calls and leads to positive structural effects. To enable the reader to reconstruct the algorithm, all four phases of the algorithm are described in detail and the complexity of them is analyzed. The overall complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of equations. It is shown that the algorithm significantly decreases the simulation time for a wide range of physical based models.<br />
