<b>Abstract:</b>User experience is an eminent part of holistic product design.
Especially in the field of mobile machinery, the
driver’s impression of the machine handling is crucial for
successful design. To get an early understanding of the ergonomic
aspects of a new concept of operation, interactive
simulation can be applied. This paper presents the tools
to develop a functional prototype using free software and
low-cost hardware. This includes prototyping of control
devices, interfaces to the simulation models and a generic
visualization using a game engine. In order to speed up the
process of functional prototyping, an approach to automatically
visualizing FMUs based on a scene description file
is presented. The application of interactive simulation was
used to support the development of a novel control device
for excavators in a student project at TU Dresden.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> A New Object-Oriented Approach for Integrating Discrete Element Method into Modelica </i> <br />

<b>Abstract:</b>In this paper we present a new library for co-simulation of
discrete element method and modelica models. For this a
component-based approach is used which allows closed
modeling and visualization of discrete element systems
in a modelica tool. Translation into a native DEM description
language and co-simulation is done by a separate
compiler and backend. Usage and functionality are shown
in a simple use case of a bucket excavator digging a hole.<br />
