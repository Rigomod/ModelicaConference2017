<b>Abstract:</b>The step-by-step self-teaching approach through audio-video
  tutorials, known as Spoken Tutorials, has been very successful.
  About 3.4 million students in India have taken at least one course
  during the past 6-year period, of which 1.6 million students have
  attended the rapidly expanding course programme during 2016. This
  programme has now been expanded by a newly developed course in
  Modeling and Simulation with Modelica using the OpenModelica open
  source tool, primarily via the OMEdit graphical user interface. The
  spoken tutorial programme is exclusively based on free and open
  source software. This paper gives an introduction to the spoken
  tutorial approach and presents the recently developed spoken
  tutorial series for Modelica using OpenModelica.  Feedback of
  participants shows that this series is an effective tool for
  self-learning of OpenModelica.  The paper also presents a new web
  version that generalises the interactive DrModelica course material,
  OMWebbook:  it enables students to learn Modelica, do text-based
  modeling exercises, and run simulations without needing to install a
  Modelica tool. OMWebbook is also planned to be covered in a future
  update to the spoken tutorial course on Modelica.<br />
