<b>Abstract:</b>In this work, an acausal multi-domain physical system model is used to study the interaction between an internal combustion engine operation and a range of cooling and lubrication system thermal cycling scenarios. Although the model can be used for modelling a wide range of scenarios, this paper concentrates on the application of engine thermal shock test dynamics prediction through coolant and lubricant cycling. An internal combustion engine is load-controlled on a dynamometer. Coolant and lubricant temperature transients are imposed on the engine system. Using freely available and commercial Modelica Libraries within the Dymola environment, the systems integration of the coolant rigs, lubricant rigs and engine is achieved. The rigs and the controllers are validated against test data to create predictive models of such systems for test virtualisation. This allows the user to develop and define control strategies for the tests from desktop, prior to engaging in laboratory tests.<br />
