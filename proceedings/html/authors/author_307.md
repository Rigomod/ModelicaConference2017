<b>Abstract:</b>Transient thermodynamic models in Modelica are widely
used for energetic simulations of machines and systems
which are located nearby people. Nevertheless, so far no
libraries exist which consider the noise of such machines
in the simulations. The Sound Source Extension library
(SSElib) proposed in this work, should close this gap.
With the aid of the SSElib, acoustic characteristics can be
added to existing Modelica models (e.g. to a compressor
model). The acoustic characteristic added to the existing
model is frequency dependent in the one-octave band and
could be further depend on an input parameter like the
rotational speed of a compressor. With the inclusion of
sound sources into energetic models, the sound behavior
of machines can be considered and control strategies can
be optimized to lower the noise of machines.<br />
