<b>Abstract:</b>The web was conceived of as a medium for the expression and
  exploration of scientific and engineering ideas.  However, observing
  the actual content on the web, an alien race might presume that the
  primary impetus for web technologies was the dessimention of cat
  videos or celebrity gossip. Fundamentally, HTML and HTTP are
  certainly sufficient for the creation of scientific and engineering
  content just as they are for the creation of online magazines and
  websites.  But while a number of "content management systems" have
  been created to facilitate the publication of prose, there are very
  few such tools that cater to making it easy to create scientific and
  engineering content.

  In this paper, we will present a platform which can be thought of as
  a content management system for scientific and engineering content.
  We will start by describing what we believe to be the fundamental
  requirements for such a system.  From there, we will discuss two
  different applications built on this platform.  The first is an
  interactive tutorial for teaching the basics of the Modelica
  languages and the other is an example application that involves
  creating interactive content for use in an engineering course on
  hydro-electric power generation.  This content will be published on
  the modelica.university domain and we invite others to
  contribute additional content to the site.<br />
