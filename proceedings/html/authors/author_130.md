<b>Abstract:</b>Modelica models can have a graphical icon defined as a bitmap or vector graphics.
Vector graphics have several benefits, the most obvious being free scaling of images from icon to poster size. With OpenModelica there already exists one open source tool that can be used for editing these vector graphics icon annotations, but it does not reach the usability comfort of professional vector graphics editing tools.

In this paper we present the Modelica Vector Graphics Editor (MoVE), a standalone open source editor for Modelica's vector graphics syntax that provides many convenience features inspired by the vector graphics editor Inkscape. These features include grouping, snap to grid, move to foreground/background, rotation handles, and drawing perfect circles and squares as well as horizontal and vertical lines when holding Shift.

We hope that MoVE, as a part of the Modelica Tool Ensemble (MoTE), can enrich the open source ecosystem of Modelica by simplifying the creation of more elaborate vector graphics icons for Modelica models.<br />

<b>Title:</b> <i> Mo|E  A Communication Service Between Modelica Compilers and Text Editors </i> <br />

<b>Abstract:</b>The Modelica language is becoming increasingly popular among scientists and engineers as platform for modelling physical or biological systems. Although Modelica is maintained as non-proprietary language by the Modelica Association, a considerable number of commercial implementations and development environments is complemented by a surprisingly small number of open source tools.

In this paper, we present the communication service Mo|E that connects any text editor as front-end with a Modelica compiler as back-end. Based on the simple HTML communication protocol, editor plugins for a software developer's favourite text editor can be developed easily, hence turning any editor into a lightweight Modelica development tool.

We also present a first implementation of a plugin for the text editor Atom that exhibits features necessary for efficient software development, such as display of compile errors, code completion, go to declaration or view of context-sensitive documentation. In addition, Modelica-specific checking of the number of equations in a model is supported.<br />
