<b>Abstract:</b>This paper belongs to a long-term research activity on modelling and simulation of large grids in Modelica, and specifically with the OpenModelica translator. We describe the present state of the research, its evolution over the last year, the conclusions we could reach in this period in comparison with the initial hypotheses, and some results. As a consequence, we outline the future of the presented activity.<br />
